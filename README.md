I have developed a Tic Tac Toe game as a web application. The project utilizes a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create an engaging and interactive experience.

HTML provides the structure and layout of the game board, CSS is used to style and customize the appearance of the game elements, while JavaScript handles the logic and functionality of the game, allowing players to make moves and determine the winner. Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, is employed to enhance the responsiveness and overall design of the game.

By leveraging these technologies, I have created an enjoyable Tic Tac Toe game that can be played directly on a web browser. The combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap ensures a seamless user experience, making the game visually appealing and intuitive to play.
